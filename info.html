    <h2>BLACKPINK</h2>
    <p><div class="a1">Blackpink</div>(<div class="b2">Korean:</div> 블랙핑크;<div class="b2">RR:</div> Beullaekpingkeu, stylized in<div class="b2"> all caps</div> or as <div class="b1">BLɅϽKPIИK</div>) is a South Korean <div class="b2">girl group</div> formed by<div class="b2">YG 
        Entertainment</div>, consisting of members<div class="b2">Jisoo, Jennie, Rosé,</div> and<div class="b2">Lisa</div>. The group debuted in August 2016 with their single album <div class="b2">Square
        One</div>, which featured <div class="b2">"Whistle"</div> and <div class="b2">"Boombayah"</div>, their first number-one entries on South Korea's <div class="b2">Gaon Digital Chart</div> and the US 
        <div class="b2">Billboard World Digital Song Sales</div> chart, respectively. <br><br>
             Referred to as the "biggest girl group in the world", Blackpink is the most successful Korean girl group internationally.
        They are the highest-charting female Korean act on the US<div class="b2">Billboard Hot 100</div>, peaking at number 13 with "<div class="b2">Ice Cream</div>" (2020), and
        on the <div class="b2">Billboard 200</div>, peaking at number one with their second studio album <div class="b2">Born Pink</div> (2022), which is the <div class="b2">best-selling album of
        all time</div> by a female act in South Korea and the first to sell over two million copies. They were the first girl group to top
        the Billboard <div class="b2">Artist 100</div> and the first Korean girl group to enter and top the Billboard <div class="b2">Emerging Artists</div> chart. Blackpink also
        became the first female Korean act to receive a certification from the <div class="b2">Recording Industry Association of America</div> (RIAA) with their
        single "<div class="b2">Ddu-Du Ddu-Du</div>" (2018). <br><br>
             Their 2018 song "<div class="b2">Kiss and Make Up</div>", a collaboration with <div class="b2">Dua Lipa</div>, was the first by a Korean group to receive a certification from 
        the <div class="b2">British Phonographic Industry</div> (BPI) and a platinum certification from the <div class="b2">Australian Recording Industry Association</div> (ARIA).
        Blackpink's debut studio album, <div class="b2">The Album</div> (2020), became the best-selling album of all time by a Korean girl group and the 
        highest-charting female Korean album on the Billboard 200 at number two, records both surpassed by Born Pink. <div class="b2">Born Pink</div> was the
        first album by a girl group to reach number one on the Billboard 200 since <div class="b2">Danity Kane</div> in 2008 and set two <div class="b2">Guinness World Records</div> as 
        the first album by a Korean girl group to top the Billboard 200 as well as the <div class="b2">UK Albums Chart</div>. The album's lead single "<div class="b2">Pink Venom</div>" 
        (2022) was the first song by a Korean group to top the <div class="b2">ARIA Singles Chart</div> and the first song by a girl group to top the <div class="b2">Billboard Global 200</div>. <br><br>
        Blackpink has broken numerous online records throughout their career. Their music video for "Ddu-Du Ddu-Du" was the first by a 
        Korean group to surpass one billion views as well as two billion views and is currently the most-viewed by a Korean group on 
        <div class="b2">YouTube</div>. Blackpink's music videos for "<div class="b2">Kill This Love</div>" (2019) and "<div class="b2">How You Like That</div>" (2020) each set records for the most-viewed 
        music video within the first 24 hours of release, with the latter breaking three and setting two Guinness World Records. 
        They are the <div class="b2">most-subscribed music artist</div> and own the <div class="b2">most-viewed music channel</div> on YouTube, and are the most-followed and 
        most-streamed girl group on <div class="b2">Spotify</div>. Their other <div class="b2">accolades</div> include the New Artist of the Year Award at the <div class="b2">Golden Disc
